                <h5>The Beer</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Membership will include 8 bottles of sour beer that will <strong><em>only</em></strong> be available to members. These beers will be released throughout 2019. If there is an overage in production, members will have the first opportunity to purchase additional bottles. After this window, if there are bottles left we may serve them at festivals or other events. These beers <strong><em>will not</em></strong> be for sale outside the membership.</li>
                    <li>As a member, you will have the first opportunity to purchase a limited number of bottles before they go on sale to the public through our provider, <a href="https://theroots.craftcellr.com/" target="_blank">theroots.craftcellr.com</a>. The sale of public bottles will be first come first served, while supplies last. We will allow you to pick up your pre-purchased bottles as early as 2PM the Friday of the release weekend.
                        <ul>
                            <li>All bottle orders have a specific pick-up window. Bottles will only be held for 2 weeks after release date. Any bottles not picked up within the pick-up window will be forfeit and will go on sale to the general public. There will be no refunds for forfeited beer.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

The sale of public cans will be first come first served, while supplies last. This also comes with the opportunity to pick up your cans prior to the general public. We will allow you to pick up your pre-purchased cans as early as 2PM the Friday of the release.
                        <ul>
                            <li>All can orders have a specific pick-up window. Cans will only be held for 1 week after release date. Any cans not picked up within the pick-up window will be forfeit and will go on sale to the general public. There will be no refunds for forfeited beer.</li>

                    </li>

                <p>The following options are available for fulfilling membership allocations and additional purchases for members:</p>

                    <li>Pick up at brewery – Orders can only be picked up during tasting room hours (aside from bottles/cans as early as 2PM the Friday of the release).</li>
                    <li>Trustee – Members may designate a trustee to pick up their beer. An ID proving that the person accepting the package is 21+ years of age will be required. Trustees can be changed at any time by filling out an Assign Trustee Form that we can email you (via <a href="mailto:theroots@highbranchbrewing.com">theroots@highbranchbrewing.com</a> email). How the pick-up is handled will be determined by you, but we will help accommodate the best we can. We will track all of this electronically through <a href="https://www.craftcellr.com/" target="_blank">craftcellr.com</a>. You can either give your trustee your sign-on information or we can enter it manually through the software when the pick-up is made.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Boring Stuff</h5>

                <li>Membership may not be cancelled, transferred, or terminated by members for any reason. High Branch reserves the right to cancel/terminate a membership if we feel something illegal or disingenuous is occurring.</li>
