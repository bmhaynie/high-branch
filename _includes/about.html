                <p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/about/tj-mo.jpg" class="img-circle img-thumbnail pull-right" style="width: 50%; height: auto; margin: 0 0 10px 10px;">To us, High Branch symbolizes always reaching for the "higher branch" and endeavoring to improve our product.</p>
                <p>We wanted to create a brewery/taproom space that is fun and lighthearted, while keeping the quality of
                our beer as the top priority.</p>
                <p>High Branch strives to use local ingredients and develop relationships with farmers and other small businesses.</p>
                <p>We can’t thank our family and friends enough as they’ve helped to make the dream of sharing our craft with the community a reality.</p>
