                <h3>Our Story</h3>
                <p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/about/tj.jpg" class="img-circle img-thumbnail pull-right" style="width: 50%; height: auto; margin: 0 0 10px 10px;">High Branch opened in November of 2015, when we decided to turn our passion for beer into a business. TJ (brewer for High Branch) discovered his love for making beer in 2009 after receiving his first home brew kit. Since then, the drive to make craft beer has been all-consuming.</p>
                <p>We wanted to create a brewery/tap room space that is fun and lighthearted, while keeping the quality of the beer as the top priority.</p>
                <p>High Branch symbolizes always reaching for the "higher branch" and endeavoring to improve the beer being produced. We strive to use local ingredients and develop relationships with farmers and other small businesses.</p>
                <p>Turning our passion into a business would not have been possible without the support of our family and friends.</p>
                <p><strong>&mdash; TJ &amp; Maureen Creighton</strong></p>
