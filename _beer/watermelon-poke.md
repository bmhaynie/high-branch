description: Poke is our interpretation of a historical Berliner Weisse. We utilize a no boil method of brewing while simply heating the wort to near boiling temperatures to sterilize it. The beer is then aged with a mixed culture for 3-6 months and aged on Concord, NC watermelons from Green Meadow Acres.
