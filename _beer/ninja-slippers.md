description: The second edition of our Ninja Slippers Collaboration with Mello Coffee Roasters in Davidson. This time they aged the coffee in a bourbon barrel prior to roasting. We then added the coffee to the beer along with vanilla beans. Lots of bourbon in the aroma with a balance of bourbon, vanilla, and nutty flavors.
