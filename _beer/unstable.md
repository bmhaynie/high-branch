description: A hazy IPA coming in at 7% ABV, smooth drinking and crushable. Unstable is a constant project for us....guess it is living up to its name! We felt the hop character was a little light with our typical recipe so we opted for a third dry hop addition on this one utilizing Citra. It will be slightly different than the past batches but maybe even more juicy with a bitterness kick on the back end. In the dry hop we used Citra, Falconers Flight, and El Dorado.
