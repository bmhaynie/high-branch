Thanks to all of our wonderful customers, High Branch is turning 1!!! We have live music all night starting at 4. [Derek Sjoblom]{:target="_blank"} and [Jackson Briody]{:target="_blank"} are kicking things off at 4, followed by [HL Ruth]{:target="_blank"} and [Spencer Bloodworth]{:target="_blank"}. This event will have a laid back, backyard vibe. We want to keep it low key and inviting. Other details and our food plans will be forthcoming.
