To kick this off we wanted to make a blog post describing what lead us to start our brewery and what our vision is. While this first post is somewhat formal (and we talk about ourselves a lot) we don't plan to make all blog posts like this.  Future posts will talk about current events, process notes for homebrewers to geek out on, and anything interesting happening at the brewery.  

So our story began several years ago with a Pale Ale homebrew kit, sorry we know it is unoriginal. The first beer was okay, but not great. The next beer got better, and more research was done. From there it quickly became an obsession. We would constantly seek out new beers to experience new flavors and use these beers as inspiration to influence TJ’s homebrewing.  

The brewing became more and more frequent and the idea of a brewery was thrown around a number of times. We got the the point where we wrote the business plan, ran some numbers and the passion continued growing.  But, like everyone else, life is fluid and things came up. The brewery was still just a dream.  Eventually, in 2014, we decided it was time to use our business plan we spent so many hours working on and we took the leap to start looking at locations,it was all downhill from there.

We knew we wanted to start a business that had the “mom and pop” feel rather than the commercialized vibe you get all too often these days. For years we have been frequent shoppers at farmer’s markets and small downtown shops. There is something rewarding to us to purchase from a local shop selling high quality wares and actually handing the money to the owner.  We wanted a business that is an extension of us, we want people to feel welcome in the taproom. It will be an unpretentious and comfortable place to hang out.   

The beer that we plan to offer will be specific, in essence it is beer that we enjoy to drink. We will focus on hoppy american ales, farmhouse inspired ales, and belgian inspired ales.  We won’t limit ourselves to these “guidelines” however the majority of our beer will fit into these “styles.”  We hope that you will enjoy it as we do. 

We don’t really envision becoming a national brewery, in the end we may never leave North Carolina and that is ok with us. We are really  looking forward to the opening and we hope you come out to enjoy it with us. At least one of the owners will be at the brewery most of the days we are open and we are happy to talk beer (or almost anything really) so come on over.

Thanks for reading and talk to you soon!
